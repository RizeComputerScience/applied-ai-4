MULTI-OBJECTIVE OPTIMIZATION WAREHOUSE SIMULATION
==================================================

OVERVIEW:
This simulation demonstrates Pareto frontier optimization in warehouse operations using
wage-productivity tradeoffs. The system tests 24 different wage levels ($0.15-$0.84)
with multiple episodes each to show the relationship between worker pay, productivity,
service quality, and profit.

SETUP AND EXECUTION:
====================

1. Navigate to the simulation directory:
   cd "/Users/douglasdahl/Desktop/AAI IV/Act 3/warehouse_rl"

2. Run the comprehensive multi-objective demonstration:
   python multi_objective_demo.py

3. View the generated Pareto frontier scatterplot:
   open wage_productivity_scatterplot.png

WHAT YOU'LL SEE:
================
- 24 different wage levels tested with 5 episodes each (120 total runs)
- Statistical reliability through multiple runs per wage level
- Color-coded scatterplot: blue=low wages, red=high wages
- Black Pareto frontier line showing optimal tradeoff curve
- Yellow circles highlighting Pareto-optimal points
- Gold star marking the single best profit-maximizing wage
- Detailed analysis table with efficiency metrics

EXPECTED RUNTIME: 8-12 minutes (24 wage levels Ã— 5 episodes each)

WAGE-PRODUCTIVITY SYSTEM:
=========================
- Worker speed scales with wage: higher pay = faster movement and task completion
- Speed multiplier ranges from 0.6x (at $0.15) to 1.5x (at $0.84)
- Each wage level represents a different strategic choice
- Multiple episodes capture the stochastic nature of the simulation

PARETO FRONTIER:
===============
The black line shows points where you cannot improve both profit AND service
simultaneously - any improvement in one requires sacrificing the other.
Points below this line are suboptimal (dominated solutions).

REFLECTION ASSIGNMENT:
======================
After running the simulation, write a 2-paragraph reflection addressing:

1. How the Pareto frontier reveals the fundamental tradeoff between wage costs and
   productivity gains, and what the shape of the frontier tells us about diminishing
   returns in worker compensation.

2. Why certain wage levels appear on the Pareto frontier while others don't, and
   what this teaches about finding optimal solutions in multi-objective optimization
   problems with complex, non-linear relationships.

Include observations about whether the highest-paid workers always deliver the best
results, and what the "sweet spot" analysis reveals about real-world management
decisions.
