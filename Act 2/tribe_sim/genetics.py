        # - fitness_scores: list of (gatherer, fitness) tuples, sorted by fitness (best first)

        # 1. Tournament selection: pick random groups, take best from each
        # 2. Roulette wheel: probability proportional to fitness
        # 3. Rank-based: select based on rank, not raw fitness values

        # - Pure elitism (current) can cause premature convergence
